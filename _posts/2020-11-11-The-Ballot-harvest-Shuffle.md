# The Ballot-harvest Shuffle

## - the unchecked underbelly of democratic elections -

"It's not the people who vote that count.	
It's the people who count the votes that count."	
Joseph Stalin

## Siegmund Biden

So, Biden brags about having 'put together the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of american politics.'

[[002]](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/10/24/joe-biden-touts-most-extensive-inclusive-voter-fraud-organization-in-history-of-american-politics/ "article on this statement")

He also calls some hackling Trump voters Chumps.
And he is old enough to know, what Chump means.
It's a gullible person, and more importantly in this context, it is a person marked for a con.
[[003]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv9J-k8kvCU "Biden calling hackling Trump supporters Chumps")
[[004]](https://www.scarymommy.com/1920s-slang/ "Defintion of Chump: someone gullible or marked for a con")

So what are these voter fraud allegations all about that Republicans and, perhaps unwittinlgy, Biden alike seem to make?

After four years of media outrage on alleged meddeling with U.S. elections, let's have a closer look.

## Politics

First of all let's have a look at who might be implicated in this kind of scheme. Could voter fraud be organized from high up?

What does the presidential candidate say about moral integrity?

He is on tape explaining in front of an audience how it is human nature and not corrupt at all, to help the people out who gave you money before an election. </br>
What is pay to play?
[[005]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQW_3lXedqM "Biden explains that pay for play is human nature and not corrupt at all")

A step below, do we see any senators that are formally accused of participating in voter fraud?

There are Texas Senator Boris Miles, Harris County Comissioner Rodney Ellis and Harris-Biden campaign's Political Director of Texas Dallas Jones under investigation for running a massive voter fraud ring.
[[006]](https://thetexan.news/biden-campaign-operative-texas-state-senator-accused-of-mail-in-ballot-fraud/ "Texas Senator, Biden political director of Texas formally accused of voter fraud")

What about the executive management level of the democratic party?
Someone arrested on voter fraud?

In Texas an arrest of four people has been made, among these a Texas democrat comissioner and his wife.
[[007]](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-official-arrested-felony-election-fraud-charges-could-face-99-year-sentence-1534183 "Vier Menschen wegen Wahlbetruges in Texas verhaftet")

## Money Trails

To follow the money, a list of where it shows up

If you want to have a massive ballot harvesting operation, there needs to be a flow of money. 

Are there any points of reference of people indicating they received money for ballot harvesting?

This may a Judge of Elections has been convicted of taking bribes to cast fraudulent ballots and certifying false voting results

Case study: could you just talk postal workers into handing you over undeliverable ballots?

Note: I would have preferred if this mans face was blurred, as this documentary points to a more general problem of election integrity by the means of the postal service

Voting machines used in battle ground states are tied to democrat establishment
[[016]](https://www.wnd.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-tied-clintons-pelosi-widely-used-battleground-states/ "voting machines that skewed the results toward biden campaign are tied to clinton and pelosi")

## Legal Actions

Several ongoing investigations and legal sentences point at the scale of voter fraud being perpetrated right now. 

A state is defying direct orders of the supreme court, a city keeping it's voting lists slush until a court ordered to clean it up. 

A senator is under investigation, as well as a political director for the Biden campaign and a county comissioner. This year a bribed judge of elections has been convicted of signing off falsified election results, vote counters mixing late ballots with ballots that arrived on time.

These examples here may be an indicator on what levels this voter fraud takes place.

## Change of Law

Democrats have implemented fundamental changes in the voting law after Trump was elected.	
Every single one of the mentioned changes coincidentally opens massive gateways for potential voter fraud.

They have switched American voting from Absentee Ballot voting to Mail-In-Ballot voting.
[[026]](https://twitter.com/GenFlynn/status/1324542952274841600 "1 min clip: AG Barr message on Mail-In-Ballot-Voting endorsed by General Flynn")
[[027]](https://nationalfile.com/mail-in-ballots-duplicated-sent-to-350000-dead-people-in-41-states/ "350.000 dead people received ballots, duplicate ballots")

In the wake of corona regulations Drive Through Voting (DTV) stations have sprung up.	
This expands curbside voting, legal for sick and disabled people to open access mc-donalds type drive through voting for everyone.
Quick, anonymous and hard to observe.
[[028]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-republicans-challenge-curbside-drive-thru-voting-lawsuit "drive through voting controversy in Texas")

DMV voting, for example since 2018 in California leads to Californian teens having to pre-register, while apparently allowing aliens illegaly living in the United States and felons to vote freely. 	
Also better check your stated party affiliation everytime you have updated your DMV, as this process now tends to change this in California.
[[029]](https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/troubled-dmv-continues-changing-california-voter-registrations-during-routine-visits/ "dmv voting in california")

Ballot harvesting allows partisan thrid parties to collect and drop off ballots. 	
Everyone loves a middle-man.

## Ballots - The Chase is On

We have seen that money does flow for the rigging of primary elections. But where would this many ballots come from?

Surely millions of fraudulent ballots can not come from any one place. Here are some news on opportunities where ballots have been or may have been harvested.

### Dead People Voting

350.000 dead people voting across 41 states
[[031]](https://nationalfile.com/mail-in-ballots-duplicated-sent-to-350000-dead-people-in-41-states/ "350.000 dead people received ballots, duplicate ballots")

[[033]](https://twitter.com/realJuanCaro/status/1324226324349751297 "116 year old voting")

220 year old voting, registered to vote at 188 years of age in 1988
[[034]](https://thedonald.win/p/11PpBJPnk8/born-220-years-ago-registered-to/ "220 year old voting, registered to vote at 188 years of age in 1988")

### Duplicate Ballots and 'You Have Already Voted Error'

Potentially 900.000 duplicate ballots across all states: Kern County has an estimated 2,379 duplicate ballots at a population of 839,631. The USA has an estimated 330 mio citicens.
A duplicate ballot could mean that someone snatches your vote and the machine says that you have already voted. People do report that the machine says that they have already voted.
[[035]](https://nationalfile.com/mail-in-ballots-duplicated-sent-to-350000-dead-people-in-41-states/ "350.000 dead people voting, duplicate ballots, you have already voted error")

a congress woman says her husband's vote was denied over a not requested absentee ballot that was apparently already counted.
[[036]](https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1325570711155585025 "testimony of congresswomans that her husbands vote was denied")

Hundreds of thosands of mail in ballot applications rejected in Pennsylvania. This would include people that can not cast their legal vote and potential scammers trying to guess an application alike.
[[037]](https://nationalfile.com/pennsylvania-has-now-rejected-over-250000-mail-in-ballot-requests/ "Pensylvania denies first 250.000 later 370.000 mail in ballot applications")

### Rejected Mail-in-ballots

26k mail-in-ballots were expected to be rejected but only 1.000 were in a race as close as Pennsylvania is made out to be. This raises serious concerns, if something has been tampered with to swing 25k ballots.
[[038]](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/pa-26000-mail-ballots-should-have-been-rejected-year-less-1000-ultimately "Pennsylvania anomaly of hardly rejected mail-in-ballots raises concern in close call district")

### Fake Driver's Licenses & Covid's Drive-through Polling

This year the U.S. got swamped with fake drivers licenses.

20.000 fake drivers licenses caught at the border in the first half of 2020

These can be  hooked up with ballots at drive-through voting stations set up for the covid pandemic.

## The Ballot-harvest Shuffle

There is an important reason why polling stations close at a certain time and do not accept new ballots. It's so you are not enticed to run around filling up areas where you fell behind with your private stash of fraudulent votes.

Dropping of undelivered ballots at a unconspicuous location:

## Fake News "Glitches" and Massive Vote-dumps

Wired voting machine errors, software glitches and sudden redistribution of cast votes have been reported in different parts of the country, all favoring Joe Biden.

Glitch example: Voting machines skewed results for the Biden Campaign in Antrim County by 6000 votes. This software is used in more than half the counties of Michigan.
[[064]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P36qnU-Ozc "Software used in 47 of 83 Michigan counties gives 6000 votes falsely to Democrats in Antrim County")

## NSA's Scorecard and Hammer programs

Sidney Powell, lawyer of General Flynn, says that it is likely that programs that have been used to rig the elections in other countries has been used to rig the US election.

Another algorithm evaluates how many votes will be needed where to win the election. Key districts are then injected with the needed votes to win an election.

Sydney Powell stresses the importance to look into this program given the ongoing election fraud and the software counting glitches we are seeing across the country.

## Voting Machines

Faulty voting machines in Gorgia received last minute update right before election day.
[[069]](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/04/georgia-election-machine-glitch-434065 "mysterious updates of glitchy voting machines before election day")

Voting machines company skewing votes towards Biden tied to democrat establishment
[[070]](https://www.wnd.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-tied-clintons-pelosi-widely-used-battleground-states/ "voting machines that skewed the results toward biden ar tied to the democrat establishment")

Abusing the system:

Voting machines need blue or black ball point pens to work properly.

Voting machines have issues with 'sharpies'.

In the Republican leaning county Gilbert, Arizona voters were given sharpies to vote, which bleed through the paper, not the pens that were also en masse at the polling station. A woman described how a polling staff member would go so far as to try to snatch the pen that she brought herself from her hands in order to replace it with a sharpie.
[[071]](https://nationalfile.com/sharpiegate-arizona-said-sharpies-would-invalidate-ballots-before-telling-republican-leaning-voters-to-use-them/ "article on voters being provided insufficient tools to vote")

Ballots have a border marking of black squares. If these are even a little in one of these squares missing the machine does not register the vote. In Republican leaning Outagamie, Wisconsin 13.400 voters were handed faulty ballots which had to be opend, copied and counted by hand, delaying the counting by 4 min per vote.
